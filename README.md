# CryptoClustering
In this challenge, I used knowledge of python and unsupervised learning to predict which price changes affect cryptocurrencies. I used StandardScaler to help compare K-Means and Principal Component Analysis of the dataset, and used hvPlot to determine the impact of using fewer features to cluster data.

I used knowledge and code gathered from class lecture, course materials, and the Xpert Learning Assistant to complete this challenge.
